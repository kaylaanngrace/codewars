# Codewars
A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata). My goal is to improve my problem solving skills and knowledge of javascript. 

## Technologies:

JavaScript

## Optimizations

Reading through others solutions on codewars and reading the MDN helps me refactor my own solutions. In doing so, it helps improve/strengthen my understanding of complexity and key concepts. 

## Lessons Learned:

The most valualbe lesson I've learned is there are mutiple approaches to solving a problem. There is a constant demand for improvement and learning as a programmer and no matter how skilled or experienced you are, you can always learn more.
